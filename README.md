This is just a small Project which i did for my family. We couldn't get track of all the books we owned so i decided to write this little program.
I have created a self hosted webApp for adding Books on the go (https://github.com/NeXoS355/booklist_webapp).

Features:

    Add Books with author, title, series info
    add Remarks to specific Books
    keep track of borrowed books
    declare if it is a physical copy or an ebook
    get Book Cover, Long Descriptions and other Infos via GoogleBooks API
    filter your list via author, series or search with fulltext
    export your list to an csv file
    add Books to your Wishlist
    rate the Book you just read with 1-5 Stars
    display interesting informations about your Database e.g. most popular series or author
