# booklist

This is just a small Project which i did for my family.
We couldn't get track of all the books we owned so i decided to write this little program.

I know that this code is not pretty by any means but it works as i want it to (at least most of the time).
Because i come from Germany i mixed up the naming scheme quite a bit.

I am just doing that to learn a bit of programming and get to know GitHub and Project Management.

Feel free to do everything you want with it.
